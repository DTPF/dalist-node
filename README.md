# Wishlist Node
This is a simple web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB that allows users to create and manage their wishlists. The application features a user authentication system, allowing users to securely create and manage their own wishlists.

### Features
The Wishlist Node application provides the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- User profile management
- Wishlist creation and management
- Item addition, editing, and deletion within wishlists
- Secure password storage using Auth0
- Responsive user interface design

### Installation
To install the application and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run npm install to install the required dependencies
4. Start the server using npm start

Note that the application requires a MongoDB instance to be running on your local machine or accessible via a remote connection. The application will look for a WISHLIST_DB_URI environment variable containing the URI of the MongoDB instance to connect to.

### Usage
Once the application is installed and running, you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. From there, you can create an account or log in to an existing account to start managing your wishlists.
